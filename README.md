# Computer Graphics Labs

## Overview

This project is a collection of laboratory works on computer graphics, developed using C++ and the Qt framework. The application includes various features such as displaying 3D objects, rotating them, zooming the camera, clipping window functions, implementing Bézier curves and surfaces, and algorithms for detecting visible edges and faces of a single convex polyhedron.

## Features

- **3D Object Rendering**: Display various 3D objects.
- **Object Manipulation**: Rotate objects and zoom the camera.
- **Clipping Window Function**: Implement window clipping to restrict rendering to a specified region.
- **Bézier Curves and Surfaces**: Create and render Bézier curves and surfaces.
- **Visible Edge and Face Detection**: Implement algorithms to detect visible edges and faces of a single convex polyhedron.

## Requirements

- Qt 5.x or higher
- C++17 or higher
- QMake for build configuration
